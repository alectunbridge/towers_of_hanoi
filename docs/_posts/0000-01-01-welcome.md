## Objective

The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:

---

## Rules

* Only one disk can be moved at a time.
* Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
* No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

---

# NO COMPUTERS

---

## Play with the puzzle - 15 mins.

* [Online version of Towers of Hanoi](https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/towerofhanoi.html)

---

## Review / discuss? - 10 mins?

* What did you think?
* Was it hard / easy?
* What did you do?
    * How did you approach the problem?
    * What techniques did you use?

---

## Break it down!

* Work with just three disks to start with.
* Gather some data
    * Make notes on what you do
    * Develop a language to describe the problem / your actions
* Gradually add more disks and see what you observe?

---

## Come up with an algorithm  - 30 mins

* Work individually

---

## Exchange algorithms - 10 mins

---

## Evaluate solutions - 5 mins?

* Do they work, are they explicit enough?
* What makes a better solution?

Note:
What is the minimum number of moves?
Walk through possible approaches / algs here?
---

* Refine solutions - 15 mins?

---

## Exchange algorithms again

* Are they better?

# FIN
