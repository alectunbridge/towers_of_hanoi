# Towers of Hanoi

The tutorial consists of some slides, and some exercises (tests) which can be completed when prompted by the slides.

To prepare, clone this project and import it into your IDE. It uses Gradle for dependencies.

### Editing the tutorial

If you wish to edit the slides, they exist in the `docs/_posts/` directory. Look at the [jekyll-revealjs](https://github.com/dploeger/jekyll-revealjs) theme for more information about how to code the slides.

### Previewing changes locally

You can preview your changes locally using docker. To do this, [install docker](https://autotrader.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/Operations/pages/105232071/Mac+-+Install+Docker) if you haven’t already and run `docker-compose up` from the root of this project in a terminal. Your changes will be visible on <http://localhost:4000/>. Any changes you make to your post will be reflected in your browser—there’s no need to restart docker. You can hit `ctrl-c` to stop the process.
