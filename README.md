# Tutorial Template

This project contains a tutorial template. Clone it (don’t fork it), change it, push it, then in the repositories settings page choose ‘master branch /docs folder’ under GitHub Pages to publish the slides. Remove this paragraph and the list below, then alter the others as required. You will need to edit the following files:

- [ ] This file
- [ ] `docs/_config.yml`
- [ ] `docs/_posts/0000-01-01-welcome.md`

The tutorial consists of some slides, and some exercises (tests) which can be completed when prompted by the slides.

To prepare, clone this project and import it into your IDE. It uses Gradle for dependencies.

### Editing the tutorial

If you wish to edit the slides, they exist in the `docs/_posts/` directory. Look at the [jekyll-revealjs](https://github.com/dploeger/jekyll-revealjs) theme for more information about how to code the slides.
